# Security policy

If you find a security vulnerability in burn2cool, please report it privately so we can fix it before public disclosure.

Preferred reporting
- Use GitHub Security Advisories: https://github.com/DiabloPower/burn2cool/security/advisories (private to maintainers)

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, please open a private contact method (see repository contacts) but avoid public issues for security problems.

What to include in your report
- Short summary of the issue and its impact (one or two sentences).
- Affected versions (release tag(s) or commit hash(es)).
- Clear reproduction steps (minimal and precise).
- Relevant logs, error messages, or outputs (as code blocks).
- A minimal proof-of-concept (PoC) if available — include PoC only in the private report, not publicly.
- Your preferred contact method for follow-up.

How we handle reports
- We acknowledge receipt within a few business days.
- We will investigate, produce a fix or mitigation, and coordinate a disclosure timeline so people can update before the issue is publicized.

Responsible disclosure guidance
- Please do not publish exploit code or full technical details until a fix has been released.
- Typical coordination windows are 30–90 days depending on severity; we will communicate schedules in private.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure.
